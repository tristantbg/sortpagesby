Kirby sortPagesBy first letter (& more)
===============================

## Legacy documentation

Kirby plugin that helps working with dated pages, such as blog posts. Provides a pagesByDate function for your templates. Tested on Kirby 1 and 2.

### Install

1. Put it in the `site/plugins` folder of your Kirby-powered site.

2. Optional: [Download or copy example templates](templates/). Some can be included as-is in your templates, but you’ll probably want to copy the relevant examples and customize them in your own templates.

### pagesByDate function

Function which returns an array of Kirby page URIs, or nested arrays when grouping by year or month.

The feature set for this function is:

- *Only* returns URIs for pages with a valid `date` or `Date` metadata field.
- Set limit dates, and by default do not return pages with a future date.
- … Which allows you to set pages to be [published in the future](#future-publishing).
- Exclude pages with a `status` metadata key set to either `draft`, `archive` or `ignore`. Pages with a different `status` or with no `status` metadata will be included.
- Option to group by letter or field.
- Use `limit` and `offset` options to limit the number of results and perhaps do some semi-manual pagination (sorry, no Kirby pagination object).

#### Usage

The `pagesByDate` function may take two arguments:

1. Source (required): A kirby Pages object which represents the set of pages to work with. Use `$pages` for all pages in the site. Or use any Kirby Pages object, such as the ones returned by `$page->children()` and `$page->siblings()`.

2. Options (optional): An array of options. [See below for available options](#option-documentation). You can also set options for this plugin [in your Kirby config files](#set-options-in-config).

If you want to work on all child pages of a given folder, you could use:

```php
$postUris = sortPagesBy($pages->find('myfolder')->children());
```

Note that we need to use `->children()`, since `$pages->find()` will return a unique page, and we need a set of pages instead.

To set some custom options:

```php
$postUris = sortPagesBy($pages, array('order'=>'asc'));
```

See the option documentation below for available options.

#### How to use in templates

Here's a basic example:

```php
<?php foreach (sortPagesBy($pages) as $postUri): ?>
<?php $post = $pages->find($postUri); ?>
<p>
  <a href="<?php echo $post->url(); ?>"><?php echo $post->title(); ?></a>
  - <?php echo $post->date('j F Y'); ?>
</p>
<?php endforeach; ?>
```

(Make sure you put `bydate.php` in your `site/plugins` folder first.)

See complete examples:

- [Simple example](templates/bydate-basic.php)
- [Example with custom options](templates/bydate-options.php)
- [Example with results grouped by year](templates/bydate-years.php)
- [Example with results grouped by month](templates/bydate-months.php)

#### Recursive listing

Right now if you’re trying to list all dated pages from different folders and at different levels, it can prove a bit tricky in Kirby 1. `pagesByDate()` used to have a `recursive` option but it was a hack with several issues so I removed it.

In Kirby 2, you should be able to use `$pages->index()`:

```php
// URIs for all pages in your site
$postUris = pagesbyDate( $pages->index() );

// URIs for all child and descendant pages in a 'blog' folder
$postUris = pagesbyDate( $pages->get('blog')->index() );
```

#### Exclude pages with `status` metadata

If you want to exclude pages from what `pagesByDate()` returns, you can add a `Status` metadata field to your pages with any of those values:

- `draft`
- `archive`
- `ignore`

These three values are hardcoded in bydate.php. In a future version I might offer an option to change them.

Note that Kirby 2 also has `$pages->filter()` and `$pages->filterBy()` which could allow you to do the same thing with any metadata key or value(s).

#### Future publishing

If you write a post with a date in the future:

    Title: Is HTML5 Ready Yet?
    ----
    Date: 2020-04-01
    ----
    Text: …

With default options, `pagesByDate` will not return this page's URI until the current server date is beyond the page’s date (even if only by a few seconds). One gotcha: if you only specify a date and not the exact publishing time, this defaults to 00:00 in the morning. If you want your post to go live at 8:00 in the morning, you could use `2020-04-01 8:00`.

Warning: the function currently doesn’t manage time zones in any way!

Let’s be clear about posts “going live”: we only mean that any place you used `pagesByDate` with the default `max` setting will not show a page with a date in the future. So the lists of posts, archives, and RSS/Atom feeds in your site all use `pagesByDate`, that makes your content almost invisible. Almost, because you can still see it if you go to the post’s own URL (unless you write some date-based logic of your own in the template that handles showing your posts).

#### Group results by year

```php
$postUris = pagesByDate($pages, array('group'=>'year'));
```

will return an array of page URIs that may look like (pseudocode):

    [
        "2013" => ["blog/some-post", "work/recent-project", "blog/another-one"],
        "2012" => ["work/older-project", "blog/yet-another-post"],
        …
    ]

where each item in the child arrays is a Kirby page URI.

See [Example with results grouped by year](templates/bydate-years.php) for relevant templating code.

#### Group results by month

```php
$postUris = pagesByDate($pages, array('group'=>'month'));
```

will return an array of page URIs that may look like (pseudocode):

    [
        "2013" => [
            "05" => ["blog/some-post", "work/recent-project"],
            "03" => ["blog/another-one"]
        ],
        "2012" => [
            "11" => ["work/older-project"],
            "01" => ["blog/yet-another-post"]
        ],
        …
    ]

where each item in the deepest arrays is a Kirby page URI.

See [Example with results grouped by month](templates/bydate-months.php) for relevant templating code.

#### Set options in config

We're using the same option keys, prefixed with 'bydate.'

For instance, adding these lines to your `site/config/config.php` would set the same thing as the default values:

```php
c::set('bydate.order', 'desc');
c::set('bydate.limit', 100);
c::set('bydate.offset', 0);
c::set('bydate.max', time());
c::set('bydate.min', 0);
c::set('bydate.group', 'none');
```

Values set in an option array passed to the `pagesByDate` will take precedence over site config.

### Option documentation

    order:      Sort order: 'asc' (oldest first) or 'desc' (newest first).
                Defaults to 'desc'.
    
    limit:      Integer. Max number of posts to return.
                Defaults to 100.
    
    offset:     Integer. Number of posts to skip. Use this and limit for
                manual pagination.
                Defaults to 0.
    
    max:        Integer (timestamp) or string (date).
                Posts from after this date won't be included.
                Defaults to the current timestamp (time()).
    
    min:        Integer (timestamp) or string (date).
                Posts from before this date won't be included.
                Defaults to UNIX epoch time (0 or roughly '1970-01-01').
    
    group:      Should the posts be grouped by year or month?
                When grouped by year, we will return an array of arrays,
                each child array containing the URI strings for a given year,
                with the year as the child array's key (e.g. '2011').
                When grouped by month, we will group by year first, then
                by month, so that means child and grandchild arrays.
                Month arrays have keys looking like '01', '02', …, '12'.
                Use var_dump to look at the resulting array's structure,
                or look at the templating examples.
